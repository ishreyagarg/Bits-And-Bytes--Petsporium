        <p class="sectionTag">ABOUT US</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag ">Pets are awesome and deserve nothing but the best. Often pets at home play with their owners. They may look happy but their real happiness comes out when they play with their own species. 
            Play-dates is a new concept that will help pet owners to provide an opportunity to their pets to play. The pet owners will be able to enter all the details of their pets including their interests, behaviour, likes, dislikes and most importantly what are you looking for in a playdate. Based on your preferences, you will be provided with suitable matches for your pet. You can contact the other pet owner(s) and fix a date. You can create a complete profile of your pet as well as keep a record of important information like their vaccinations. You will be able to capture and share beautiful/ funny moments of/ with your pet like pictures and videos. 
            Future expansions of the app will include providing additional services like pet food, pet accessories, pet care (day care for pets), vet appointments and vaccination alerts and most important a query forum where we connect the pet owners to pet specialists</p>
